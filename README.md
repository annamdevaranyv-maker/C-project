# C-project
1. Project description

Our team Astro coder had built this Mini Cricket Simulator using the C programing. The Mini Cricket Simulator lets the user choose two team names, gives each team eleven players. This runs a short limited overs match and we need to give the input – runs, wides, no balls, out and it records batting and bowling statistics and after completion it writes the scorecards to the file scorecards.txt and it prints the match result.

2. Overview of the Mini cricket simulator and how it works:

Team and player creation: we have created the linked list of eleven batsmen for each team and also the linked list of eleven bowlers for each team and give each player a default name that follows the pattern <Team>_P<number>.

It run toss simulation by using rand() for the toss. we also use rand() for the choice to bat or bowl.

Innings simulation: For a fixed number of overs (OVERS = 2), the program:

Accepts a bowler number each over.

When we see each ball we record input. The input includes runs, from zero to six, out, wide or no ball.

Updates batsman and bowler statistics accordingly.

Handles extras, free hits (simplified), wicket-taking and selecting next batsman (disallowing the non-striker or already out players).

Swaps the batmen at the end of each over.

Score display and file save: After each innings the batting scorecard and the bowling summary are printed. The batting scorecard and the bowling summary are then added to the file scorecards.txt.

Final result: After both innings, the program prints match result (winner and margin).

Memory cleanup: we make sure the program frees the allocated memory before the program exits.

3.Explaination of functionalities:

a) Data structures:

struct Batsman stores player name, runs, balls, fours, sixes, out flag, and a next pointer (linked list node).

We define the struct Bowler to hold the bowler name. The struct Bowler also holds the runs given the balls bowled, the wickets and the next pointer.

b) Player list creation:

The functions used for this player list creation are BatsmanList(team, players),BowlerList(team, players). BatsmanList(team, players) this function was created build the batting lineup for a team , we created name like TeamA_P1" using snprintf. We attach each new node to the linked list, so all batsmen are connected in order. This  function returns the head of the linked list. BowlerList(team, players) same function as that of batmen but it used balls bowled, wickets taken , runs given. This function returns the first bowler in linked list.

c) Toss:

 Toss is generated by a rand().

d) Running an innings (innings):

Initialize total runs, extras, wickets, and set striker = first batsman and non_striker = second batsman.

For each over:

Prompt for bowler number and locate the bowler node.

For each of up to 6 legal deliveries :

Prompt for ball input.

If wide: increment extras and bowler's runs given; count as extra ball and allow re-bowled.

If there is a no ball then add one run. Increase the bowler runs by one. Ask for a hit run value, between zero and six. Add the hit run value to the batsman. Add the hit run value to the bowler. Add the hit run value to the totals. The behavior is simplified.

If the striker is out mark the striker as out. Increment the bowlers wickets. Ask for the batsman number. Do not accept a number that belongs to the non‑striker or, to the out players. Update the striker.

If numeric 0–6: add to batsman runs/balls, bowler stats; swap strike on odd runs.

After over, swap striker and non-striker.

After innings, print batting scorecard and bowling summary and call saveScore.

e) Saving and cleanup

saveScore(team, bHead, boHead, totalRuns, extras) appends readable scorecard to scorecards.txt (with fopen check).

freeList frees the linked lists. FreeList does this to avoid leaks.

f) Search Player Function:

After the match is over, the user can search for any player by entering their name (like TeamA_P1).
The program opens the scorecards.txt file in read mode and checks each line.
If a line starts with the entered player name, that line is printed as the player's batting or bowling record.
If the name is not found, the program displays a “Player not found” message.


f) The function innings: The function innings returns an int. The function innings takes a char array team a pointer to struct Batsman bHead and a pointer to struct Bowler boHead.
The program runs an innings, for the team. The program reads ball, by ball input updates the batsman stats and the bowler stats updates the totals and the extras prints the scorecard and the bowling summary saves the score and returns the runs including the extras.

g) struct Batsman* BatsmanList(char team[], int players)
Allocates and returns a linked list of players batsmen with default names <team>_P#. Initializes runs/balls/fours/sixes/out to zero.

h) struct Bowler* BowlerList(char team[], int players)
Allocates and returns a linked list of players bowlers with default names <team>_P#. Initializes runs_given/balls_bowled/wickets to zero.

i) void saveScore(char *team, struct Batsman *bHead, struct Bowler *boHead, int totalRuns, int extras)
Appends a formatted scorecard (batting and bowling stats and totals) for team to scorecards.txt. Handles file open errors gracefully.

// FreeList frees the lists.
// The function freeList takes a pointer to a Batsman list head named bHead and a pointer, to a Bowler list head named boHead.
// The function freeList frees the memory, for both lists.
j) void freeList(struct Batsman *bHead struct Bowler *boHead)
Frees all allocated memory for both batsman and bowler linked lists to prevent memory leaks.

k) int main()
Program entry point: reads team names, constructs batsman & bowler lists, simulates toss, calls innings for both teams in the correct order, prints final result, searches player's details if the user asks and frees memory.
